                    <p>I've made a huge tiny mistake. Don't worry, these young beauties have been nowhere near the bananas. You don't want a hungry dove down your pants. Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw. I'm in Vegas this week and would like to point out the Blue Man Group is *actually* hiring. The support group? Oh, like when they say poofter to mean tourist, yes.</p>
                    <p>Ah, it is a rock, though. Should beat everything. Gob: There's not a lot of logic to it. Let's make Ann the backup, okay? Very good way to think about her, as a backup.</p>
